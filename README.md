### üßê About

We are a group of senior programmers developing an application for our Software Engineering I course.

As a group, we are fairly active, and we are tired of having bloated, slow fitness tracking apps. So we decided to change that. MyBanana is a simple application where a user will create an account, and we will then take the users height, weight, and activity level to automatically calculate their daily potassium and water intake. Did you know that you can survive 11 days on only water and bananas? 

### üçå Why MyBanana?

Potassium and water are the two main nutrients needed for adequate muscle functioning. Having sufficient levels of both help with muscle recovery as well preventing cramping during a workout or run.
