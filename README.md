### üßê About

We are a group of senior programmers developing an application for our Software Engineering I course.

As a group, we are fairly active, and we are tired of having bloated, slow fitness tracking apps. So we decided to change that. MyBanana is a simple application where a user will create an account, and we will then take the user's height, weight, and activity level to automatically calculate their daily potassium and water intake. Did you know that you can survive 11 days on only water and bananas? 

### üçå Why MyBanana?

Potassium and water are the two main nutrients needed for adequate muscle functioning. Having sufficient levels of both helps with muscle recovery as well as preventing cramping during a workout or run.

### üöÄ Deployment

Running React projects are simple and easy!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
